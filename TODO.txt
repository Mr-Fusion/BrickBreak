Game Engine TODO:

- Streamline LoadMedia Functions for various gamestates
	* Centralized Class for sound/Texture files?
	* Load assets on an entity basis?
- Implement levels as sub-loops
	* Need to define loop structure
- Improve font handling
	*gFont may not be deallocating properly

Breakout TODO:

- Powerups:
	* Identification between powerups
		~ Different texture/Icons (For colorblind players)
- Special effects?
	* particles/animations?


Known Bugs:
- Whichever texture is rendered last causes all gRenderer entities to flicker when updated
	* Potentially need to take load off gRenderer somehow
- In rare instances, the "Paused" info text does not appear when the game is paused
