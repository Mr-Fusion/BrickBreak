Game Engine TODO:

- Streamline LoadMedia Functions for various gamestates
	* Centralized Class for sound/Texture files?
	* Load assets on an entity basis?
- Implement levels as sub-loops
	* Need to define loop structure
- Improve font handling
	*gFont may not be deallocating properly

Breakout TODO:

- Powerups:
	* Identification between powerups
		~ Different texture/Icons (For colorblind players)
- Special effects?
	* Sound Effects
	* particles/animations?
- General Balancing
	* What should be the min/max ball speed [Need to playtest]
- Miscellaneous
	* Improve transitions (Game start, lose ball, game over, etc)
	* Code Cleanup/Refactoring
	* What happens when all levels are cleared?

Known Bugs:
- Whichever texture is rendered last causes all gRenderer entities to flicker when updated
	* Potentially need to take load off gRenderer somehow
- In rare instances, the "Paused" info text does not appear when the game is paused
